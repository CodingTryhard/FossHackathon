# Brainwave.

Brainwave is a web-app planned to help students achieve their full potential when self-studying.


## UI (Proposed)

The current model only allows for displaying the active featues of the web-app in a very basic manner (due to time constraints and a few other reasons). However, a more sleek and attractive UI has been designed and will be implemented as per the availablity of time.

![Basic UI Design, scaled](https://github.com/A0D1I2L3/FossHackathon/assets/146623102/9645ad8c-2210-4c9c-afa7-5a68bfa201ef)

## Existing features
These are the basic features that are planned to be made available right from the launch of the app.

1.	Pomodoro Timer:
Currently locks the user onto the countdown page. Provides 4 options for the timer, which can be divided into
- Pomodoro: 20+10Break
- No break: 30+0 Break
- Long break: 15+15Break
- Short break: 25+5Break


2.	To-do List/Scheduler: Allows user to mark down assignments and pending work as per their schedule. The list is always presented in a way that the one with the closest deadline is at the top.

3.	FocusStream: Allows a distraction free environment when watching YouTube classes/other online lectures. Also has a section to take down notes, which will then be made available on the “My Notes” section.

4.	Notes Collection: Allows a community driven approach to collecting available notes for a given subject/module. 

5.	Achievements/Medal System: Rewards users for the work and effort they put into their education in the form of medals. Provides a slight motivation which could lead to more effort from the students.


## Planned Features

1.
AI Driven Syllabus analyzer: Allows students to input their syllabus into an AI GPT which will then provide users with the most optimal plan to achieve their goals. This can then be added into the scheduler/calendar in one click, or be adjusted to the user’s wish and then be added to the scheduler.

2.
Updates to the scheduler is planned, allowing the user to add directly to the calendar, providing an opportunity to use the To-Do list for more upcoming tasks/of other importance.

3.
Community driven quiz web-app is planned for development. Allows users to test their knowledge in a competitive environment. Can also be further used by educators to test ther students.
4.
More additions to the note taking section, mainly adding a number of different note taking methods, allowing students to use a method that suits their method of studying the most.
